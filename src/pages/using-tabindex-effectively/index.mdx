title: Using tabindex Effectively

From where I stand, `tabindex` is an underutilized HTML attribute. That being said, when used incorrectly, it can prove disastrous! Let's talk about the when and the how of `tabindex`.

## Making "Non-Clickable" Elements Focusable

With JavaScript, its easy to make an element clickable. Either through DOM manipulation or via a framework like React, making a `<div>` as interactive as a `<button>` is trivially easy. Unfortunately, a `<div>` will not be a part of the document's tab order like a `button`! That's where `tabindex` comes in handy.

Let's say we have a `<div>` that opens up a modal when clicked like so:

```html
<div class="button">
  I trigger some behavior.
</div>
```

By default, the keyboard cannot find this element, and thus, neither will screen readers be informed that the elememnt is interactive. This is a huge problem from an accessibility standpoint! This is a clear violation of the [WCAG 2.1 guideline](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#keyboard-accessible) regarding keyboard accessibility.

To remedy that, add `tabindex="0"` _and_ `role="button"` to inform screen readers that the element is interactive.

```html
<div class="button" tabindex="0" role="button">
  I trigger some behavior.
</div>
```

Ta-dah! The element can now receive keyboard focus whenever the user hits the tab key.

## Making Elements Programmatically Focusable

With JavaScript, moving focus to an element is often required in order to help improve user experience, and frequently a must-have when making complex interactions accessible for all users. THat being said, focus can't be moved to just any old element. Consider the following example:

```html
<div class="alert alert--error" id="my-alert">
  Warning! Invalid password.
</div>
```

Let's say we want to move focus to this alert:

```javascript
document.querySelector('#my-alert').focus()
```

Unfortunately this won't work! We need to first add _some_ value for `tabindex`. So let's try `tabindex="0"` like before:

```html
<div class="alert alert--error" id="my-alert" tabindex="0">
  Warning! Invalid password.
</div>
```

Woohoo! This works. Sort of.

Unfortunately, what we've done is introduced the alert in to the keyboard tab order. As a user tabs through interactive elements, they then encounter the alert, only to find that it isn't actually an interactive element.

### Negative tabindex to the Rescue!

This is when leveraging `tabindex="-1"` comes in to play. This makes the element both programmatically focusable _and_ keeps the element outside of the tab order of the document.

So, we end up with:

```html
<div class="alert alert--error" id="my-alert" tabindex="-1">
  Warning! Invalid password.
</div>
```

### Other Values for tabindex

Other, positive values are technically valid for use with `tabindex`, however, these should _pretty much never ever be used_. By supplying positive values for `tabindex`, the "natural" tab order of the page can be modified, unfortunately resulting in accidental keyboard tab traps, a big [accessibility no-no](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#no-keyboard-trap).

## Wrapping Up

`tabindex` is a critically important attribute, particularly when working to build a page that is usable for keyboard-only users _and_ our friendly neighborhood power user.

To summarize:

1. Add `tabindex="0"` to elements that are typically non-interactive that have been made interactive by JavaScript
2. Add `tabindex="-1"` to elements that need to receive focus programmatically but should not be a part of the keyboard order of the document and
3. Never _ever_ use a positive value for `tabindex`
