title: A Typescript Monster Battler

I was inspired to finally bite the bullet and try out Typescript after listening to NPM's Laurie Voss on [Shop Talk Show Episode 345](https://shoptalkshow.com/episodes/345/). The following is a brief run through of what I discovered along the way.

## A Project

I've always been curious about game development, and as such, wanted to use this opportunity to dip my toe in to some basic text-based gaming mechanics through a Node.js application. I knew I could pretty quickly build some JavaScript modules for rolling dice, determining NPC stats, and ultimately, simple turn-based combat. Why not spice things up with Typescript while I'm at it?

### Tools

I had some basic architectural requirements I wanted to stick with when authoring my first TypeScript app:

1. Use Node.js to build a text-only interface,
2. Make use of ES6 modules,
3. and use [Jest](https://jestjs.io) for unit testing

This structure was mainly meant to mimic common tools I typically use during day-to-day work.

## Getting Started

### The Build

#### ES6 Modules in Node.js

I've gotten used to writing JavaScript modules using the newer, [ES6 import](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import) syntax. Node.js (at least at the time of writing!) does not play nicely with said syntax by default, but that's easy to resolve with a build in flag and the `.mjs` file extension:

```bash
node --experimental-modules ./index.mjs
```

#### TypeScript

After initializing a project through NPM, installing TypeScript is easy enough:

```bash
npm install typescript --save-dev
```

I then leveraged NPM's somewhat new `npx` feature to run the TypeScript CLI and compile `.ts` files to JavaScript.

##### Handling .mjs

But wait a minute, don't these files need to be compiled to `.mjs` rather than `.js` if I want to use ES6 imports? A small file named `toMJS.bash` to the rescue:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

for file in ./dist/*.js
do
  mv "$file" "${file%.js}.mjs"
done
```

#### Bringing the Build Together

Using NPM scripts, all of the commands can be brought together quite nicely via the `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "clean": "rm -rf ./dist",
  "build": "npm run clean && npx tsc",
  "prepare": "sh toMJS.bash",
  "start": "npm run build && npm run prepare && node --experimental-modules ./dist/index.mjs"
}
```

### Testing

Writing tests using Jest is a breeze - it's easy to get started, simple to configure, and runs tests efficiently. Making it work with TypeScript, however, did require a bit of know-how.

#### Playing Nicely with TypeScript

Installing Jest is very straightforward:

```bash
npm install jest --save-dev
```

Unfortunately, at least at the time of writing, Jest does not support TypeScript out of the box. That's nothing a good `npm install` can't solve!

```bash
npm install ts-jest @types/jest --save-dev
```

A little configuration in the `jest.config.js` and we are up and running:

```json
"transform": {
  "^.+\\.tsx?$": "ts-jest"
},
"testRegex": "(/__tests__/.*|(\\.|/)(test|spec))\\.tsx?$",
```

#### Playing Nicely with ES6 Imports

Like Node, Jest does not support ES6 modules out of the box. Once again, our friend `npm install` will save us.

```bash
npm i @babel/core @babel/preset-env babel-jest --save-dev
```

And just some tiny configuration in a `.babelrc` file:

```json
{
  "presets": ["@babel/preset-env"]
}
```

## Writing Some Modules

I won't go in to detail regarding all of the modules in the project, as those can easily be found in the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/nicklemmon/typescript-monster-battler), however, I hope to go over how I leveraged TypeScript features when authoring.

### Rolling a Die

Rolling "dice" is pretty straightforward. A simple JavaScript function can handle the work, and with TypeScript, required parameters have types. Here is `rollDie.ts`:

```typescript
export default function rollDie( numberOfSides: number = 6 ) {
  return Math.floor( Math.random() * numberOfSides ) + 1;
}

```

Types paired with [default parameters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Default_parameters) really offer some power! Not only will future developers be restricted to passing in numbers when it comes to the number of sides on a virtual die, but they won't have to pass in anything if they want to use a traditional 6-sided die.


### A Monstrous Interface

[Interfaces](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/interfaces.html) allow consistent, predictable structuring of objects, and in this project's case, monsters!

```typescript
export default interface Monster {
  name: string;
  strength: number;
  dexterity: number;
  toughness: number;
  vitality: number;
}
```

And later, in our `index.ts`, we create a `Cyclops` that leverages the `Monster` interface:

```typescript
const Cyclops: Monster = {
  name: 'Cyclops',
  strength: 10,
  dexterity: 2,
  toughness: 8,
  vitality: 10
}
```

We can even use this interface to build other functions, particularly functions that accept a `Monster` as an argument. For example, the `getHP()` function:

```typescript
import Monster from './Monster';

export default function getHitPoints( monster: Monster ) {
  return monster.toughness + ( monster.vitality * 2 );
}
```

## Final Thoughts

Authoring with TypeScript has some clear benefits. Predictability and consistency are enforced via a system of checks that occur when TypeScript is compiled, reducing the risk of defects and making code more concise.

Though the benefits are clear, ideally, both Node and Jest would support TypeScript out of the box. Getting a working development environment is feasible with current tools, however, takes a little more work than I expected considering the popularity of the language. Hopefully as the web development community continues to welcome our new TypeScript overlords, the tooling can catch up appropriately.
